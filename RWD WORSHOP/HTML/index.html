                        <p>Zomato was founded as Foodiebay in 2008, and was renamed Zomato on 18 January 2010 as Zomato Media Pvt. Ltd.In 2011, it expanded across India to Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune and Ahmedabad. In 2012, it expanded operations internationally in several countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Sri Lanka,Qatar, the United Kingdom,the Philippines,and South Africa. In 2013, expanded to in New Zealand, Turkey, Brazil and Indonesia, with website and apps available in Turkish, Portuguese, Indonesian and English languages.In April 2014, it launched in Portugal, which was followed by launches in Canada, Lebanon and Ireland in 2015.

                            In 2015, the firm acquired Seattle-based food portal Urbanspoon, which led to the firm's entry into the United States and Australia. This U.S.-expansion brought Zomato into direct competition with similar models such as Yelp and Foursquare.
                            
                            With the introduction of .xxx domains in 2011, Zomato also launched zomato.xxx, a site dedicated to food porn. In May 2012, it launched a print version of the website named "Citibank Zomato Restaurant Guide," in collaboration with Citibank, but it has since been discontinued. </p>

                        <p>The innate liking for sweet and salty taste can make it difficult to move consumers away from nutrient poor foods. However, taste preferences and subsequent food choices can be changed by repeated exposure especially during childhood during which taste preferences play a major role in food choice and consumption </p>
